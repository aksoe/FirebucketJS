# FirebucketJS
This project is a extended part of the [Firebucket Android application](https://github.com/remychantenay/Firebucket).

I am not too familiar with front-end development and JavaScript, my apologies
if the code is not first-class :)

This project is nothing more than a way to play with what I've learn.
It only comes from my curiosity to see how Firebase fits with Vue.js.
